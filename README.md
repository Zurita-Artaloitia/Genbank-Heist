Genbank-Heist is a small program written in Python for extracting the genomic context of a certain gene from a complete Genbank file.

It allows the user to define the number of upstream or downstream genes it prints, relative to the target ID.
The ID can be either the LOCUS_TAG or the PROTEIN ID.
The output is printed with the ID your proportioned + .gbk in the same directory as the input file.
You just need to run the program with Python3, all the user input will be asked for after running.
